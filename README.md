Step 1:   Create Repository in Git & share project of eclipse into that Repository.

Step 2:   Create Branch in Git---- created branch named Readme1 off of master branch. 
          * Master branch is always deployable, Entire github flow is based upon master branch
          * New Branch name must be discriptive.
          
          
Step 3:   Add Commit to new branch---- this commits are done in Readme1 file or branch. 
          * Once branch is created, its time to start making changes or commits 
          * Adding Commit means-(Add file, Delete file, or Edit file)
          * Commits also create a transparent history of your work that others can follow to understand what you've done and why.

Step 4:   Pulling Repository---  Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits.
          * Pull Requests helps to start code review and conversation about proposed changes before they're 
            merged into the master branch.
          * You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself.
          
Step 5:   Merge Your Pull Request--- In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together 
          – merging your Readme1 branch into the master branch.
           
          i. Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
         ii. Click Confirm merge.
        iii. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, 
             with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
